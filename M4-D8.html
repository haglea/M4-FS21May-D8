      In this exercise you'll apply your new knowledge about react-router-dom. Remember to install the package from npm
      (npm i react-router-dom).

    <h1>Netflix App - React Router</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create a Route for a ShowDetail component. It should be able to receive a ID parameter from the querystring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create the ShowDetail component that receives from the url the ID parameter and fetches all the informations
        about the movie (from omdb & comments too).
      </li>
      <li>Make every Show (Movie or Series) clickable and create an onClick redirect to the ShowDetail route.</li>
      <li>
        From the main component pass also a prop called 'title' to every other component wrapped inside a Route, and use
        it for displaying inside of it the title of that section (in an "h1").
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>EXTRA</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a Link for TV Shows in the Navbar to navigate to a TV Shows component.</li>
      <li>
        Pass a route parameter named "series" in the TV Shows component route and use it for querying APIs like:
        ?s={series}&type={series}.
      </li>
      <li>Display results accordingly, and link every show in the result with its detail page.</li>
      <li>If you haven't already, polish the browsing experience with loaders.</li>
    </ul>

        You have a CRUD endpoint for comments on:

        https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/comments/

        This means you can GET, DELETE, POST, PUT data from there.

        The Comment structure is this:

        {
          "comment": "A good movie but definitely I don't like many parts of the plot",
          "rate": 3,
          "elementId": "tt1756545"
        }

        Where:
        - comment is the comment inserted by the user
        - rate is a value between 1 and 5
        - elementId is the imdbID of the movie / serie
